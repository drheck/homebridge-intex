# Homebridge Intex Plugin

This is a Homebridge platform plugin for Intex Pools.

## Publish Package

When you are ready to publish your plugin to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), make sure you have removed the `private` attribute from the [`package.json`](./package.json) file then run:

```
npm publish
```

If you are publishing a scoped plugin, i.e. `@username/homebridge-xxx` you will need to add `--access=public` to command the first time you publish.

#### Publishing Beta Versions

You can publish *beta* versions of your plugin for other users to test before you release it to everyone.

```bash
# create a new pre-release version (eg. 2.1.0-beta.1)
npm version prepatch --preid beta

# publsh to @beta
npm publish --tag=beta
```

Users can then install the  *beta* version by appending `@beta` to the install command, for example:

```
sudo npm install -g homebridge-example-plugin@beta
```
